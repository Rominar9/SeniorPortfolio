    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Romina Rambarran, and I’m a passionate senior student interested in technology, coding, and innovation. 
      I enjoy solving problems, learning new skills, and creating meaningful digital projects. I hope in the future I'm able to accomplish all my goals.

        <div class="cfu-description">
          <p>For CFU 1 I created a new scene in Unity and added 3D objects 
            like planes and cubes. I applied materials, used physics so 
            the cubes could fall and tumble, and experimented with scaling 
            and coordinates. One challenge I faced was adjusting the view 
            and object rotation, but I improved with practice.</p>

        <div class="cfu-description">
          <p>In CFU 2 I imported the IntroToUnity package and all its assets 
            into my Unity project. I opened the Playground scene to explore
            the setup and make sure everything loaded correctly. Then I 
            imported the TextMeshPro (TMP) Essentials package so I could 
            use text features in the scene.</p>

          <p>In CFU 3 I opened the Playground scene in Unity and practiced flying 
            through the hoops in the Scene window. I recorded the screen while 
            moving through each hoop to show control and navigation. It was fun 
            to practice camera movement, though keeping a smooth path through 
            all the hoops was a bit challenging at first.</p>

        <div class="cfu-description">
          <p>In CFU 4 I used the Scene view gizmo in Unity to change my view and 
            explore the scene. I rotated and switched between different angles 
            until I found the hidden word. I recorded the screen while doing this,
            and although it took a little time to line up the camera just right,
            it helped me understand how to control the view better.</p>

          <p>In CFU 5 I recorded myself adding a new object in Unity. 
            I opened the Hierarchy, created a 3D cube, and placed it 
            in the scene. It was simple to do, and I learned how easy 
            it is to add and position new objects in Unity.</p>

          <p>In CFU 6 I recorded myself adding materials to objects in Unity.
            I created a new material, changed its color, and applied it to
            a cube and plane in the scene. It was interesting to see how 
            materials change the look of objects and make the scene more 
            colorful.</p>

          <p>In CFU 7 I recorded myself adding a Rigidbody component to a 
            cube in Unity. I selected the cube, opened the Inspector, 
            and added the Rigidbody so it could fall and react to gravity. 
            It was cool to see the cube start moving naturally once I pressed Play.</p>

          <p>In CFU 8 I recorded myself adding more cubes in Unity and 
            experimented with global and local coordinates. I moved 
            and rotated the cubes using both coordinate systems to
            see how they affected the cube’s direction and alignment. 
            It helped me understand how object movement works differently 
            depending on which coordinate system I use.</p>

          <p>In CFU 9 I added a prefab game object to my Unity scene and 
            took a screenshot of it in the Hierarchy and Scene view. 
            It was easy to drag the prefab into the scene, and I could
            see how it kept all its original settings and components. 
            This helped me understand how prefabs make it faster to 
            add repeated objects or characters.</p>

        In Lab 3, I created a simple obstacle course game in Unity. 
        This mini project was designed to help us learn the basic tools
        and features of Unity, including creating environments, placing 
        obstacles, and moving a character through the course.

        The Congressional App Challenge is a nationwide competition that encourages 
        students to create original apps that solve real world problems. For this
        challenge, my team and I collaborated to design an app focused on mental
        health awareness. Our goal was to help young adults manage anxiety and stress
        through engaging activities. The app includes a personal journal for self reflection,
        mini games to help users relax, and a main game where you grow and nurture a virtual
        plant as you progress toward better mental well being.
